# Generator Simple Java
A Yeoman Generator that allows you to create a Java Playground File / Class

Take a look at the [basic sample file](https://github.com/xremix/Generator-Simple-Java/tree/master/samples/MyClass.java)

## Options
- `Class Name` will provide the name for the class and filename
- `Include Test Class` will move the `static void main` to a Test Class and generate sample code to instantiate the main class. Check out the [sample file with test class](https://github.com/xremix/Generator-Simple-Java/tree/master/samples/MyClassTest.java)
